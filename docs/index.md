# Welcome to the TALI Project Documentation
> Home Assistant knows what happens. TALI learns why.

TALI (**Task Adaptive Learning Interface**) is a self-evolving home intelligence system designed to observe, learn, 
and act within a smart home environment. It extends Home Assistant by building its own understanding, generating 
automations, and evolving tools autonomously.

TALI’s core design philosophy is **autonomous learning first**: it learns by observation, not configuration.
